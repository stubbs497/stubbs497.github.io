        <p>Libra is one of the twelve Zodiac signs. Libra is one of the air signs, along side of Aquarius 
            and Gemini. This sign is represented by the scale, and is the only sign to be represented by an
            object. The ruling planet of Libra is Venus. Libra is represented by the traits of
            balance, compassion, diplomacy, morality and more. Libras are most compatable with
